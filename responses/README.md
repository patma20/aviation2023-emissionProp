# Responses
The responses to the reviewer comments are stored here.
Two example scripts are here:
- `response.tex` uses the `mdolab-response` class file which can be found in the `mdolab_publishing` repo
- `response_multiple_colors.tex` is similar, but a standalone script that uses different colours for each reviewer

Make sure to rename the files with `R0_` or `R1_` at the beginning, corresponding to each round of review.
Once the review is submitted (along with the updated paper), a release should be made, with the PDFs attached.
