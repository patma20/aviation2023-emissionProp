# Figures
- All the source (e.g., tikz), scripts (e.g., Python), and data used to generate the figures must be included (unless the data sets are to large, e.g. 3D CFD).
- When multiple files are involved for one figure, create a folder with the same filename as the figure.
- Please name your files in a logical way.
